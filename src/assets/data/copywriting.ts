// APPLICATION
const applicationIntro = "Garuda Hacks is Southeast Asia’s largest hackathon, with over 6000 total participants. We are a 501c3 nonprofit dedicated to empower young Indonesians with skills and motivation to solve the country’s most urgent issues. Despite their skill and ideas, many talented programmers lack the resources to succeed in the job market- as a result, we began our organization in 2020, launching our first hackathon online. Since then, we have hosted SEA’s largest hackathons for five years consecutively, and have helped thousands of students develop in both computer science and entrepreeruship."
